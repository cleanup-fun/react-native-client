  `
  Why do we use register and forgot password as the same form?
  We want to avoid hackers finding out what users exist and which do not.
  If a hacker were to register under an email that already exists and we returned an error, they'd now know that user exists.
  If we only supported forgot password for emails that exist, the hacker could figure out which users exist.
  To protect the identity of our users, we try to make sure nobody knows.
