# Not Sure

- DONE - Lightbox
  - opening the file externally is probably good enough
  - but it may be a nice feature
  - https://github.com/vinzscam/react-native-file-viewer


- Storage Statistics
  - Its easy to show Total Available and Total Used
    - https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/#getfsinfo-promisefsinforesult
  - Do I itemize it?
  - seems like a lot of work with minimal payoff

- Sorting by string
  - with list [ "ac", "c", "abb" ] it normally would sort to be ["abb", "ac", "c"]
    - do I want to sort it by length first? ["c", "ac", "abb"]

- Putting the webhook auth token in an environment variable
